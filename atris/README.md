# atris 1.0.6

Graphical tetris game.

**Bug:** Local stack buffer overflow.
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=290230

## Notes: 

1.  While it is possible to get atris and `atris_comb.c` to compile on 64-bit
    machines (using gcc's `-m32` flag and the 32-bit versions of the required
    libraries) no one, to our knowledge, has successfully replicated this
    experiment on a 64-bit architecture. Let us know if you succeed.
2.  Requires the following ldflags: `-lSDL -lpthread -lSDL_ttf`.
3.  Requires that the 32-bit SDL 1.2 library is installed, together with the TTF
    package. All required packages are handled by `install.pp`

## Files

* `atris_comb.c`: combined source code, generated by Cilly, over which the
  repair should operate.
* `install.pp`: handles the installation of the pre-requisites for installing
  and executing this program.
* `test/*.out`: reference outputs for each test case.

## Tests

* **Negative:** sets the `HOME` environment variable to a very long string
  (that overflows the allocated buffer), runs the variant, and passes/outputs a
  line to the output file if the variant produces the expected output and does
  not crash.
* **Positive:** contains one test case which checks the standard help output
  is retained, by checking it against a reference output, and another checks
  whether a standard invocation returns an expected output.

## Requirements

* libsdl1.2
* libsdl-ttf2.0
