t5: Test input files. t11 is the "bad" test.

test-bad.sh: "bad test" script. Passes fuzz input t11 to the program under test
and outputs "t11" to the output file if the program terminates and does not seg
fault (create a core dump).

test-good.sh: "good tests" script. Passes 5 other fuzz test inputs to the
program under test and compares the result to the reference output. Writes a
line per passed test to the passed-in output file.
