wu-ftpd 2.6.0
=============

Description: an FTP server daemon for UNIX systems.

Bug: format string vulnerability; the first such found in the wild:
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-13.html
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1387/exploit â€” wuftpd-god.c

Notes
------

1. Requires a 32-bit architecture and the ability to open ports.
2. We operate on the combined source code, in ftpd_comb.c.  Combine wuftpd into
   single C file (ftpd_comb.c), as explained in the top-level README.  The
   original source is in wu-ftpd-2.6.0.tar.gz; the vulnerability is at line 1929 of
   ftpdcmd.y, copied from wu-ftpd-2.6.0/src/
3. ldflags:  -lresolv -lcrypt -lnsl
4. In general this one has given some trouble in the past, mostly due to
   default ftpd configuration on various machines; we have succeeded on various
   flavors of Fedora, but good luck to you.  
5. Patch: the patch disables verbose debugging output, but does not otherwise
   limit functionality. 
6. Requires limit60.
7. The exploit is explored by a wuftpd-god, a program that dynamically probes a
   running instance of wuftpd to craft an attack string.  It sometimes gives up.
